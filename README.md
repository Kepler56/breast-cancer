# Breast Cancer Prediction

## General info
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. 
It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

We have a new dataset describing the Breast cancer (Source Kaggle). Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. 
They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The 3-dimensional space is that described in: ”K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ”Robust Linear 
Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets”, Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34”.

The dataset can be found on <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.

<b>To Do: Make a comparative study between Logistic regression and Naive Bayes.<b>
